## Flag classification strategy by Ratio

1. Drawbacks of traditional flags classification strategies.

- By marking each flag: Easy, but subjective.
- By location distance: Still subjective, depends on many other factors.

2. Function to calculate ratio that correct answer will occur.

Ratio = [ correct count / total call count ] * 100

- Flags start from ratio of Zero are considered as difficult.
- Flags start from ratio of 100 are considered as easy.
- Then flags start from the middle are considered as normal.
